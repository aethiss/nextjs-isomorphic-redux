This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate created by Aethiss.

## Reason

This idea is a full isomorphic app. Each request on ANY route is managed by the node server.

 - Server Side Render on first request
 - Single page application benefits navigating client side
 - Redux Store aligned and sync server/client
 - Example of server side render page
 - Example of client side render page
 - Redux using redux-toolkit, hydrated on each server side request
 - Example of Class Component & Functional Component
 - Example of Jest Test with React Test Render  

## Getting Started

First, clone this repo:

Then

```bash
npm install
 #or
yarn
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/SSR` or `pages/CSR`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
